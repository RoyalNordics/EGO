# EGO Custom Bags - 3D Viewer Example

This example demonstrates how 3D bag models can be integrated into the EGO Custom Bags website using Three.js. It provides a basic implementation of a 3D viewer that allows users to:

1. Select different bag types
2. Choose materials
3. Pick colors
4. Select hardware finishes
5. View the bag from different angles

## Purpose

This example serves as a proof of concept for the 3D visualization feature described in the [2D to 3D Conversion Workflow](../../docs/2d-to-3d-conversion.md) document. It demonstrates the technical approach for integrating 3D models into the existing design process.

## Implementation Details

The example uses:

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D computer graphics in a web browser
- **Placeholder 3D Models**: Simple geometric shapes representing different bag types
- **Material Simulation**: Basic material properties to simulate leather, suede, canvas, etc.
- **Interactive Controls**: Camera controls for rotating, zooming, and viewing the model from different angles

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use the controls panel on the left to:
   - Select a bag type
   - Choose a material
   - Pick a color
   - Select hardware finish
3. Use the view buttons below the 3D viewer to see the bag from different angles
4. Click and drag on the 3D viewer to rotate the model manually
5. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out

## Limitations

This example has several limitations compared to a production implementation:

1. **Simplified Models**: Uses basic geometric shapes instead of detailed bag models
2. **Limited Materials**: Basic material simulation without textures or normal maps
3. **No Persistence**: Designs are not saved between sessions
4. **No Backend Integration**: Standalone example without connection to ordering system

## Next Steps

To develop this into a production-ready feature:

1. Replace placeholder models with actual 3D bag models created in CLO 3D / Marvelous Designer
2. Implement realistic materials with proper textures and lighting properties
3. Integrate with the existing design process and database
4. Add design saving functionality
5. Optimize for performance across different devices

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML structure for the 3D viewer interface
- `styles.css`: CSS styling for the viewer interface
- `viewer.js`: JavaScript implementation of the 3D viewer using Three.js

## Browser Compatibility

This example requires a browser with WebGL support. Most modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) support WebGL, but older browsers may not display the 3D viewer correctly.
