# Tote Bag Design Templates

This directory contains 2D design templates for tote bags. These templates can be used as a starting point for creating new tote bag designs or as reference for the 2D to 3D conversion process.

## File Naming Convention

Files in this directory follow this naming convention:

- `tote-[variant]-[view].[extension]`

Where:
- `[variant]` is the specific tote design (e.g., basic, structured)
- `[view]` is the perspective (front, side, top, back)
- `[extension]` is the file format (afdesign, svg, pdf, png)

## Design Notes

When creating tote bag designs:

1. **Proportions**: Maintain a height-to-width ratio of approximately 0.9:1 for classic tote proportions
2. **Handles**: Position handles approximately 10-12 cm from the sides
3. **Bottom**: Consider adding a gusset or boxed bottom for increased capacity
4. **Hardware**: Place hardware attachment points at stress areas (handle connections, etc.)

## Conversion Tips

When converting tote designs to 3D:

1. Start with the main body as a single pattern piece
2. Create separate pattern pieces for handles, pockets, and gussets
3. Use a stiffness setting appropriate for the material (higher for leather, lower for canvas)
4. Add internal structure for structured totes
