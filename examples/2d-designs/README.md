# 2D Bag Design Templates

This directory contains sample 2D design templates for EGO Custom Bags. These templates serve as examples of how to prepare 2D designs in Affinity Designer for conversion to 3D models.

## Purpose

These templates provide:
1. Reference designs for different bag types
2. Examples of proper measurement notation
3. Templates that can be used as starting points for new designs
4. Examples of how to organize design files for the 2D to 3D conversion process

## File Organization

The 2D designs are organized by bag type:

```
2d-designs/
├── tote/
│   ├── tote-basic.afdesign       # Affinity Designer source file
│   ├── tote-basic-front.svg      # Front view export
│   ├── tote-basic-side.svg       # Side view export
│   ├── tote-basic-top.svg        # Top view export
│   └── tote-basic-measurements.pdf # Measurements document
├── crossbody/
│   └── ...
├── clutch/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Design Guidelines

When creating 2D designs for conversion to 3D:

1. **Create Orthographic Views**:
   - Front view
   - Side view
   - Top view
   - Back view (if different from front)

2. **Include Precise Measurements**:
   - Overall dimensions (height, width, depth)
   - Strap/handle dimensions
   - Hardware placement
   - Interior compartments

3. **Use Layers for Different Components**:
   - Base bag structure
   - Handles/straps
   - Hardware components
   - Decorative elements
   - Measurement annotations

4. **Export Formats**:
   - Save source files in Affinity Designer format (.afdesign)
   - Export views as SVG for best vector quality
   - Include a PDF with measurements
   - Export high-resolution PNGs for texture references

## Conversion Process

These 2D designs can be converted to 3D models using:

1. **CLO 3D / Marvelous Designer**:
   - Import SVG files as reference images
   - Create pattern pieces based on the designs
   - Apply measurements from the reference documents
   - Stitch patterns together to create 3D models

2. **Custom Development Tool** (future):
   - Upload Affinity Designer files directly
   - Input measurements through the tool interface
   - Generate 3D models automatically

## Adding New Designs

When adding new design templates to this directory:

1. Create a new subdirectory for the bag type if it doesn't exist
2. Include all necessary views and measurements
3. Follow the naming convention: `[bag-type]-[variant]-[view].[extension]`
4. Update this README if adding a new bag type category

## Sample Templates

This directory includes templates for the following bag types:

- Tote bags
- Crossbody bags
- Clutch bags
- Shoulder bags
- Backpacks
- Hobo bags

Additional templates will be added as the product line expands.
