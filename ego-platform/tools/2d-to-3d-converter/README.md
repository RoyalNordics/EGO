# 2D to 3D Bag Pattern Converter

This internal tool helps the design team convert 2D bag patterns (SVG files) into 3D models with accurate measurements. It streamlines the workflow from initial 2D designs to 3D visualization.

## Purpose

The 2D to 3D Converter addresses several challenges in the bag design process:

1. **Efficiency**: Automates the time-consuming process of manually creating 3D models from 2D patterns
2. **Accuracy**: Ensures measurements are precisely transferred from 2D to 3D
3. **Consistency**: Provides a standardized approach to 3D model creation
4. **Visualization**: Allows early visualization of designs to catch issues before production

## Features

- **SVG Import**: Load SVG files containing bag pattern pieces
- **Measurement Tools**: Add, edit, and manage measurements for pattern pieces
- **Pattern Management**: Organize multiple pattern pieces that make up a complete bag
- **3D Visualization**: View the assembled 3D model based on pattern pieces and measurements
- **Export Options**: Save 3D models in various formats for use in the customer-facing interface

## Workflow

1. **Import**: Load a 2D SVG pattern file
2. **Annotate**: Add or verify measurements for each pattern piece
3. **Configure**: Set material properties and assembly relationships
4. **Generate**: Create the 3D model based on the pattern and measurements
5. **Refine**: Adjust positioning and relationships between pattern pieces
6. **Export**: Save the 3D model for use in the customer-facing interface

## Technical Implementation

The tool is built using:
- **SVG.js**: For parsing and manipulating SVG files
- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and model creation
- **Custom algorithms**: For pattern assembly and 3D transformation

## Getting Started

1. Place your SVG pattern files in a directory accessible to the tool
2. Launch the tool by opening `index.html` in a web browser
3. Use the "Import SVG" button to load your pattern
4. Follow the workflow steps to add measurements and generate the 3D model

## Directory Structure

- `/css/` - Stylesheets for the tool interface
- `/js/` - JavaScript files for tool functionality
- `/assets/` - Images, icons, and other static assets
- `/templates/` - Measurement templates and pattern presets (to be added)

## Future Enhancements

- Measurement templates for common bag types
- Batch processing of multiple patterns
- Integration with version control for pattern files
- Advanced material simulation
- Automatic measurement detection from SVG
