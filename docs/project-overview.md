# EGO Custom Bags - Project Overview

## Background

EGO Custom Bags was founded on the growing trend of personalization in retail, particularly in accessories and jewelry. The concept emerged from observing customers' positive reactions to a "design your own" feature in a previous bag business, which demonstrated that consumers are increasingly ready to design their own accessories online.

The business capitalizes on two major trends:
1. The rapid growth of online shopping
2. The increasing demand for personalized products

By allowing customers to design their own high-quality bags that are delivered within a short timeframe, EGO positions itself in a unique market space with significant growth potential. The concept can be easily expanded to include other products such as wallets, belts, and luggage.

## Business Concept

EGO's core business concept is to enable customers to design their own bags through an intuitive online platform, based on a range of templates. The bags are manufactured with high-quality materials, positioning EGO as a premium brand where quality and corporate social responsibility are paramount, while the design is left to the customer.

The business is conceived as an international venture from the outset, targeting women aged 16-60, as well as men looking for gifts for the women in their lives.

## Design Process

The design process is divided into six distinct steps:

1. **Base Design Selection**: Choose the fundamental bag shape and style
2. **Handle Type Selection**: Select the preferred handle style
3. **Material Selection**: Choose from various high-quality materials
4. **Color Selection**: Pick colors for both the bag and handle
5. **Fittings & Details**: Select hardware, zippers, clasps, and decorative elements
6. **Review & Order**: Confirm the design and place the order

Each design receives a unique identifier, allowing customers to reuse their designs for different products in the future or reorder previously designed items.

## Market Analysis

The e-commerce market has seen substantial growth, with a 70% increase in Denmark alone from 2011-2016, reaching 70.4 billion DKK. The first half of 2017 already saw 56.9 billion DKK in sales.

While specific statistics for leather bag sales worldwide are limited, data from the US shows that Americans spent 11.5 billion USD (approximately 73.8 billion DKK) on women's handbags in 2016, a 5% increase from the previous year.

## Competitive Advantage

EGO differentiates itself from competitors through:

1. **High Quality at Competitive Prices**: Premium quality products at prices that make them accessible to a broader market
2. **Rapid Delivery**: 14-day delivery time, half the industry standard of 4-5 weeks
3. **Extensive Customization Options**: Over 3.2 million possible combinations
4. **Design Reusability**: The ability to save designs and apply them to other products

## Target Market

- **Primary**: Women aged 16-60, representing approximately 38% of the Danish population. If similar demographics apply across Europe, this represents over 300 million potential customers.
- **Secondary**: Businesses looking to create custom bags that match their branding or for promotional purposes.

## Marketing Strategy

EGO's marketing strategy focuses heavily on viral marketing, encouraging customers to share their designs and purchases with their networks. The strategy includes:

1. **Digital Marketing**: Google AdWords and Facebook advertising
2. **Influencer Marketing**: Providing gift cards to influential individuals who can create trend-setting effects
3. **PR Initiatives**: Television appearances and continuous social media engagement
4. **Search Engine Optimization**: Based on popular keywords related to bags and leather goods

## Product Strategy

EGO's product strategy centers on:

1. **Quality and Design**: Using only the highest quality materials, with continuous refinement and expansion of designs every 3-6 months
2. **Customer Satisfaction**: Ensuring products exceed customer expectations, with a quality management system that includes regular updates on order status
3. **Competitive Pricing**: Bags priced between 1,200-3,000 DKK depending on size, materials, and details
4. **Product Line Expansion**: Plans to extend into wallets, belts, and travel bags

## Operational Structure

EGO aims to maintain a lean organizational structure, outsourcing tasks where quality and business considerations allow. Key operational elements include:

1. **Production**: Manufacturing primarily in Turkey or Portugal
2. **Distribution**: Handled by UPS for direct delivery to customers
3. **Customer Service**: Initially managed by the founder, with plans to expand as international sales grow

## Supplier Strategy

EGO's supplier strategy focuses on:

1. **Capacity**: Seeking suppliers with a minimum production capacity of 50,000 bags per month
2. **Flexibility**: Ensuring suppliers can create each bag according to exact customer specifications
3. **Redundancy**: Working with multiple suppliers to ensure production continuity
4. **Quality Control**: Regular audits (both scheduled and unannounced) to maintain quality standards

## Implementation Timeline

EGO estimates a six-month timeline to market:
- Months 3-6: Website design, production, and testing
- Months 3-6: Supplier audits and contract finalization
- Months 3-6: Design and material selection
- Months 3-4: Test orders through the system
- Month 4: Marketing campaign launch

## Capital Requirements

Initial capital requirements total 390,000 DKK:
- Startup costs: 300,000 DKK
- Marketing: 90,000 DKK

The business model is designed to be self-financing for production, as customers pay the full amount online at the time of order, while suppliers typically require 30% upfront and the remainder upon delivery.
