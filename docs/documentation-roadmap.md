# EGO Custom Bags - Documentation Roadmap

## Introduction and Purpose

This Documentation Roadmap serves as a strategic guide for managing all documentation throughout the EGO Custom Bags project lifecycle. Effective documentation is critical to the success of the project for several reasons:

- **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensures that project knowledge is accessible to all team members
- **Consistency**: Maintains a consistent understanding of features and functionality
- **Onboarding**: Facilitates faster onboarding of new team members
- **Quality Assurance**: Provides a reference for testing and quality assurance
- **Future Development**: Supports future maintenance and feature development

This roadmap outlines how documentation will be created, maintained, and evolved as the project progresses.

| High | Significantly impacts user experience or development efficiency | Within 1 week |
| Medium | Moderately impacts user experience or development | Within 2-4 weeks |
| Low | Minor impact on user experience or development | Next scheduled update |

### Prioritization Factors

1. **User Impact**: How many users are affected and how severely
2. **Development Dependency**: Whether other development tasks depend on this documentation
3. **Business Value**: Alignment with business goals and revenue impact
4. **Resource Availability**: Available time and expertise to complete the documentation

### Version Control

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Include version number in document header
- Maintain a changelog within each document
- Use the task-completion.sh script for committing documentation changes

### Maintenance Section Template

Each document should include a maintenance section at the end with the following format:

```markdown
