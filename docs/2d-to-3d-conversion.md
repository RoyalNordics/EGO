## Immediate Solution: CLO 3D / Marvelous Designer

### Overview

[CLO 3D](https://www.clo3d.com/) and [Marvelous Designer](https://www.marvelousdesigner.com/) are specialized software solutions for fashion and accessory design that can convert 2D patterns with measurements into realistic 3D models.

### Workflow

1. **Prepare 2D Designs in Affinity Designer**
   - Create detailed front, side, and top views of each bag design
   - Include precise measurements for all dimensions
   - Export designs as high-resolution PNG or SVG files

2. **Import into CLO 3D / Marvelous Designer**
   - Create a new project
   - Import Affinity designs as reference images
   - Use the pattern tools to create 2D patterns based on your designs
   - Input measurements for each pattern piece

3. **Generate 3D Model**
   - Arrange pattern pieces in 3D space
   - Stitch patterns together using the software's tools
   - Apply physical properties (thickness, stiffness) appropriate for bag materials
   - Simulate to generate the 3D model

4. **Apply Materials and Textures**
   - Import material textures from your Affinity designs
   - Apply to appropriate sections of the 3D model
   - Adjust material properties (shininess, bump, etc.)

5. **Export for Web Use**
   - Export as FBX or OBJ format
   - Convert to glTF using tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for web optimization
   - Optimize textures and geometry for web performance

### Software Acquisition

- **CLO 3D**: [Pricing](https://www.clo3d.com/pricing) starts at approximately $50/month
- **Marvelous Designer**: [Pricing](https://www.marvelousdesigner.com/product/pricing) starts at approximately $50/month
- Both offer free trials to test functionality

### Training Resources
