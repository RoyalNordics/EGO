# EGO Internal Tools

This directory contains internal tools used by the EGO development team for various tasks related to the custom bag design and manufacturing process.

## Tools

### 2D to 3D Converter

The 2D to 3D Converter is an internal tool that helps the design team convert 2D bag patterns (SVG files) into 3D models with accurate measurements. This tool streamlines the process of creating 3D representations of bag designs for use in the customer-facing customization interface.

**Key Features:**
- SVG pattern import and parsing
- Measurement annotation and extraction
- 3D model generation from 2D patterns
- Pattern piece assembly visualization
- Export to various 3D formats

**Directory Structure:**
- `/2d-to-3d-converter/` - Main tool directory
  - `/css/` - Stylesheets for the tool interface
  - `/js/` - JavaScript files for tool functionality
  - `/assets/` - Images, icons, and other static assets
  - `/templates/` - Measurement templates and pattern presets

## Development Guidelines

When developing internal tools:

1. **Documentation First**: Ensure each tool has clear documentation on its purpose, usage, and architecture
2. **Consistent Styling**: Follow the internal tools style guide for UI consistency
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for a smooth user experience
4. **Performance**: Optimize for the specific use case, considering the technical expertise of the users
5. **Feedback**: Include mechanisms for users to report issues or suggest improvements

## Adding New Tools

To add a new internal tool:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Include a README.md file explaining the tool's purpose and usage
3. Follow the standard structure (css, js, assets)
4. Update this main README.md to include the new tool
